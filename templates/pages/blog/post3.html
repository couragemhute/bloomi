                <strong>Beyond the Classroom: Why Entrepreneurial Thinking Powers Every Career</strong>
                <br>
                Innovation doesn’t happen by accident. Our 6-week Introduction to Entrepreneurial Skills course gives students the mindset and toolkit to turn ideas into opportunities. It blends crisp theoretical modules with immersive exercises that make entrepreneurship real.
                <br><br>
                For every two hours of learning concepts such as business models, customer discovery and pitching, students spend five hours applying them — validating ideas, mapping out value propositions and building simple prototypes. They don’t just talk about entrepreneurship; they practice it.
                <br><br>
                Feedback and iteration sessions teach them to listen, adapt and refine their ideas — a critical habit for any entrepreneur or intrapreneur. By presenting their concepts to peers and mentors, students strengthen communication, teamwork and resilience.
                <br><br>
                By course end, they’ve experienced the entrepreneurial journey from ideation to pitch. Whether they go on to launch a startup or innovate within an organisation, they’ll have a competitive edge in thinking creatively and acting decisively.
                <br><br>
                This is more than an entrepreneurship class; it’s a catalyst for self-reliance and innovation. Don’t just prepare your student to get a job — equip them to create one.
